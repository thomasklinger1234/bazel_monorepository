## About Monorepos

A monorepo is a software development approach where all code is stored in a single repository. Some things are easier to do in a monorepo, such as sharing a proto file across front-end and backend, some things are harder, such as per-repo control over collaborators, email notifications, commit history etc. 

Some good reads about the monorepo approach:
